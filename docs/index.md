# Overview

> People currently think of text as information to be consumed. I want text to be used as an environment to think in. - [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/#!/ExplorableExplanations)

Over the course of more than 30 years, the Web has evolved from a niche project for researchers openly sharing information to the dominant platform for open, interactive multimedia content. But still, leveraging this platform for education remains difficult: How can you create such content without coding?

WebWriter tries to provide an answer, allowing educators to create their own open, interactive multimedia content. That content can be thought of as truly digital worksheets, also called Open Explorables.

WebWriter is the product of a dissertation project at [RWTH Aachen University's Learning Technologies Research Group](https://learntech.rwth-aachen.de).
